## Data Collection
Currently the only data that Ray collects is device GPS data when requesting information (ie. forecasts) for your current location.

## Data Usage/Storage

I (the developer) do not use or store any of the data that is currently collected, which includes use in advertising and analytics, although this has the potential to change in the future.

### OpenWeatherMap
Forecasts gathered by Ray are all sourced from the OpenWeatherMap API. In this process location data is sent, however is not bundled with any other information. The OpenWeatherMap privacy policy can be found <a href="https://openweather.co.uk/privacy-policy">here</a>.
