Development was started on FullCart in 2018, but stopped being maintained after its initial release.
This is a full redesign and rerelease completely overhauling the UI and keeping up with modern Android development practices.
<br><br>
It is available on the Play Store as a beta at the moment, with a lot more planned for its future.
