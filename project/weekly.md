Weekly was created as a way to keep track of tasks and goals, but with flexibility.
Current goal tracking apps and implementations generally assign a goal to a certain day
or time which I found unhelpful and unintuitive. So Weekly splits the goal concept
into two parts: a goal and a task. A task is something to be done on a specific day,
maybe at a certain time whilst a goal is something to complete over a week, a month or even a year.
These goals can be time based, count based or simply success or failure, but it ensures that
there isn't any pressure to complete them when you don't feel like it.
